#define COMPONENT_DESCRIPTION_CDATADUMPSINK "This component writes dataMemory data to a raw binary file (e.g. for matlab import). The binary file consits of 32-bit float values representing the data values, concattenated frame by frame along the time axis. The first two float values in the file resemble the file header, an thus indicate the dimension of the matrix (1: size of frames, 2: number of frames in file). The total file size in bytes is thus <size of frames>x<number of frames>x4 + 2."
