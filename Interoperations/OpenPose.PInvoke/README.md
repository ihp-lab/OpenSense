# About

Integrate OpenPose using PInvoke.
Based on OpenPose's [Unity Plugin](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose_unity_plugin).

We turn to PInvoke because we met difficulty using C++/CLI.
Because of OpenPose's chaotic dependencies, we are unable to debug.
You can find the C++/CLI version in the last commit.
